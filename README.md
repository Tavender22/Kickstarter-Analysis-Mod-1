# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
A data analysis of US-based Kickstarter campaigns with a focus on Plays. The objective was to determine key success factors from the data provided to help in launching a successful campaign for a new play. We found that most successful plays in the US launched their campaigns in Q2, and Theatre campaigns had their most successful years in 2014-2016.

Additionally, successful campaigns had an average goal a little of $5,000, and a mid-point (median) of $3,000. Failed campaigned has average goals over $10,000, with a Median of $5,000. When compared to the pledged amounts we note that failed campaigns received far lower pledge amounts indicating there may have been other issues with the kickstarter campaigns.

Mean Goal	 $5,049 	 $10,554 
Median Goal	 $3,000 	 $5,000 
Standard Deviation of the Goal	 $7,749 	 $21,968 
Upper Quartile of Goal	 $5,000 	 $10,000 
Lower Quartile of Goal	 $1,500 	 $2,000

# Kickstarter Challenge Week 1: Fundraising: Launch Date and Goal Analysis

## Overview of Project:

Following the success of the *Fever* kickstarter fundraising campaign, Louise has requested an analysis of how different campaigns faired in relation to their launch date and their funding goals, and what recommendations can be made from the data to help with future Kickstarter campaigns.

### Purpose

Can we determine if the success of a kickstarter fundraising campaign is positively or negatively impacted by the launch date of the campaign, or the size of the fundraising goal; and how should this information impact future fundraising campaigns for Louise.

## Analysis and Challenges

For our analysis we continued to use the Kickstarter campaign data from our previous report. We reviewed two primary data items to determine the impact: 
  
  1. Campaign Outcomes based on Launch Date; and
  2. Campaign Outcomes based on Fundraising Goal Amount.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

For this analysis we reviewed the broader *Theatre* category, with 1,369 outcomes charted by the month of their launch campaign. From the chart we can draw a few conclusions:
1. There is an increase in campaigns launched between April and August, peaking in May, and declining for most of the year thereafter.
2. In all months except December, Successful campaigns are noticeably more successful than failed campaigns. 
3. The widest difference between Successful and Failed campaigns occur during the May-July time period, with the gap being much closer in all other months.
4. Canceled campaigns remain relatively consistent throughout all the months, and a minimal as a percentage of the total.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

By reviewing the fundraising goal amount we hoped to determine if the size of the goal impacted potential success rates. We reviewed the subcategory of *Plays* in our review. There were 1047 total projects, and interestingly none were canceled in the sample.
1. For goals under $15,000, we see successful campaigns exceed failed campaigns, with a couple of teirs:
  - for both ranges (0-$999; $1,000-$4,999) over 73% of campaigns are successful.
  - for $5,000-$9,999 and $10,000-$14,999, the success rate drops to 55% and 54% respectively.
2. From $15,000 - $34,999, more campaigns failed than were successful.
3. There is a slight blip up to 2/3 success rate between $35,000-$44,999; but there is a very small sample size, with only 9 campaigns out of our sample.
4. For our two categories above $45,000, only 2 in 17 campaigns reached their goal.

Our sample size is also heavily skewed towards campaigns under $10,000, representing 889 campaigns out of our 1,047 total (or 85% of our sample).

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

1. We have compared the *Theatres* parent category in our Outcomes by Launch Date vs. our Outcomes by Goal, where we used *Plays*. Given plays make up the majority of the *Theatre* category, it likely is still representative.
2. Our sample size is heavily skewed on the Outcomes vs. Goals analysis towards smaller fundraising goals. This should provide a high level of confidence in the results for groups under $15,000, but much less confidence for higher groups - especially when we see jumps in success rates.
3. Additional data points, or included IQR, Standard Deviation, statistics analysis could also help increase the level confidence we could have in the resuts.


## Results

After reviewing our charts and data for our two outcome categories, the following conclusions can be drawn:

### Outcomes based on Launch Date
1. The largest spread between success and failure occurs in May, followed closely by June. These are also the two busiest months for new campaign launchs. We would recommend launching a campaign in May.
2. Campaigns launched in Q1 and Q4 have the lowest success rates vs. failed campaigns. We would not recommend launching a campaign in Q1 or Q4.

### Outcomes based on Fundraising Goal
1. Fundraising campaigns under $15,000 have a greater than 50% success rate. In addition, campaigns under $5,000 have a greater than 73% success rate. We would recommend a fundraising goal that is less than $5,000.

### Limitations of the dataset
1. Geographic location is fairly large. It would be better to narrow the data down, either to country or even to region (if data was abailable);
2. Theatre, and Plays, are broad categorties - Is there addition genre data available?
3. There may be other factors outside of the dataset that we have that are more important to determining success of a campaign. 

### Other possible tables/graphs to be shown (using parent category: *Theatre*, or subcategory *Plays*)
1. Outcomes vs. Pledged amount: Is there a trend or certain level of pledged amount that indicates success.
2. Outcomes by country: Are certain countries more or less successful?
3. Outcomes by # of backers: If a caompaign have more backers does it lead to greater success?
4. Backers/Pledges Vs. Month: are backers more active in certain months than others? Are larger pledges more likely in certain months?
